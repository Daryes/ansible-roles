#  --storage.tsdb.retention.time=15d
#                             How long to retain samples in storage. When this

#                             streaming remote read response types before
#                             marshalling. Note that client might have limit on

#                             state. This is maintained only for alerts with
#                             configured "for" time greater than grace period.
#  --rules.alert.resend-delay=1m
#                             Minimum amount of time to wait before resending

#                             The capacity of the queue for pending

#                             into memory. Note that queries will fail if they
#                             try to load more samples than this into memory,
#                             so this also limits the number of samples a query
